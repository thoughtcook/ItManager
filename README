ItManager-----A opensource project just for The Newbies of C Plus Plus (CPP) to better understand the concepts of CPP language. This project tries to embrace the CPP concepts as much as possible, Inheritance, Polymorphic, Encapsulation, Template, Algorithm, etc. Enjoy! :-) 

In this project, I simulate the role of a IT department, which is responsible for the computer management of a company, include computer buying, updating, employee equipment, abandoned computer disposal, etc. 

A computer consists of CPU, Memory, and Disk. 

There are three kinds of computer for a employee to choose:
a) Desktop;
b) Laptop;
c) Pad;

One employee can have one Desktop at office, and choose A laptop or a Pad for evection.

As It department, It has several responsibilities as following:
1) Buying computer for company;
2) Update the hardware, only Desktop and Laptop can update;
3) Allot Computer to new employees;
4) Dispose abandoned computers.
